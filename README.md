This project runs on AVR ATmega328p and generates a variable-frequency square wave (50–1000 Hz) using Timer1. The base frequency is set by an analog input (ADC), with fine adjustment via UART commands (+ / -). An LED on Timer2 performs a continuous fade effect, and Timer0 provides timing for periodic UART status output. A push button puts the MCU into idle sleep mode, stopping the signal and LED until released.
